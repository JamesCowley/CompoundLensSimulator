# Simulating compound lenses in Mathematica

## Background
Created in year 2 of my MSci Theoretical Physics course at UCL (date ~ February 2013). The project's aim was to simulate compound lenses of different shapes and composition to minimise various kinds of optical aberration.

The project proceeded in the following way:
1. Model individual light rays passing through a boundary between media of different refractive indices.
2. Model solid lenses out of intersecting circular boundaries.
3. Track multiple rays to see how an image would be distorted by each lens.
4. Add mutliple lenses to the system.
5. Vary size, shape and composition of lenses to try and achieve magnification with minimal aberration (distortion).
