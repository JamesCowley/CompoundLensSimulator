# Simulating compound lenses in Mathematica

### Background
Created in year 2 of undergrad physics. The project's aim was to simulate compound lenses of different shapes and composition to minimise various kinds of optical aberration.

### Breakdown
1. Model individual light rays passing through a boundary between media of different refractive indices.
2. Model solid lenses out of intersecting circular boundaries.
3. Track multiple rays to see how an image would be distorted by each lens.
4. Add mutliple lenses to the system.
5. Vary size, shape and composition of lenses to try and achieve magnification with minimal aberration (distortion).

### How to view it
Notebook (`.nb`) files can be opened in Wolfram [*Mathematica*](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica).

The file `Functions.nb` contains each important function of the project and an example graphical output.

The file `Aberration_Plots.nb` just contains some plots from the final report.
